# Solidity


## Value type

Value types store their data directly when you assign a value type to another variable, you get a copy of the value.
This happens because value types (like integers, booleans, addresses, etc.) store their actual data directly in the variable. Each variable has its own separate copy of the data.


## Reference type

In Solidity, reference types (arrays, structs, strings, and mappings) are stored as pointers. When you pass these types around, Solidity doesn't copy all the data; it just references where the data is stored.

- storage: Permanent storage on the blockchain (expensive)

Used for state variables.

Data persists between function calls and transactions.

Most expensive in terms of gas costs.

- memory: Temporary storage during function execution (cheaper)

Only exists during function execution.

Cheaper than storage.

Used for function parameters, return values, and local variables.

- calldata: Read-only temporary storage for function parameters (most efficient)

Similar to memory but read-only.

Can't be modified.

Most gas-efficient.

Used primarily for external function parameters.

## Data box

- Be careful with loops in Solidity because each operation costs gas, and loops with too many iterations can exceed block gas limits. This is known as a denial of service (DoS).

- msg.value: The amount of ETH (in wei) sent with the function call. Only available if the function is marked as payable

- Events in Solidity are like announcements that your contract makes when something important happens. Events should be emitted when the contract state is updated

- The _ in the modifier represents where the function code will be executed. For example, if the _ is before the modifier logic, the function will be executed before the modifier logic.

- ABI : The ABI is like a smart contract's instruction manual that tells applications exactly how to talk to your contract on the blockchain.

It describes, using structured data, exactly what functions and data types are available for use in the contract and how to “call” or use them.
## Naming convention

- Contracts: PascalCase (like SimpleToken)

- Functions/variables: camelCase (like balanceOf)

- Private/internal state variables: prefix with _ (like _owner)

## Libraries and Inheritance

- Library : Libraries are reusable pieces of code that you can share across multiple contracts. Think of them as toolboxes containing helpful functions that your contracts can use.

1. Embedded Libraries: Use internal functions that get copied into your contract's code

2. Linked Libraries: Use external and public functions. These functions don't get copied into your contract's bytecode - instead, your contract makes calls to the deployed library

- Inheritance : Inheritance lets one contract build upon another. Think of it like building with blocks—you start with a foundation and add more features.

In Inheritance we can override functions or extend them using **super**

```solidity
contract ExtendedToken is BaseToken {
    function getTokenName() public override pure returns (string memory) {
        // Call the parent function and add to it using the super keyword
        return string.concat(super.getTokenName(), " Plus");
        // Returns "BaseToken Plus"
    }
}
```

When using inheritance parent contracts import order is important. If two contracts contain a function with the same name and child contract uses of super with the function name, then it will use function from first inherited contract

## Introduction to Oracles

Blockchains are deterministic system, meaning that given the same input the system will produce the same output. Due blockchain isolated nature, blockchains cannot directly access off-chain data. Blockchains process transactions with higher latency than traditional computing systems due to their need for global consensus. Blockchains cannot fetch real-world data independently, limiting smart contracts functionalities => Oracle problem

A blockchain oracle is an infrastructure component that enables secure data exchange between blockchains and external systems. Decentralized oracles provide a trust-minimizing mechanism for bringing off-chain data onto the blockchain and allow smart contracts to be executed based on real-world events or off-chain computation.

### Types of Blockchain Oracles
- Inbound Oracles: These oracles bring external data to the blockchain. For example, they deliver information such as weather conditions, sports scores, or stock prices into a smart contract.

- Outbound Oracles: These oracles send data from the blockchain to external systems. They enable smart contracts to communicate and interact with off-chain systems.

- Consensus Oracles: These oracles aggregate data from multiple sources and provide a single source of truth to the smart contract. This is done to improve the reliability and accuracy of the data.

- Cross-Chain Oracles: These oracles facilitate communication and data exchange between different blockchain networks (each of which is like an isolated “island”). Cross-chain oracles are essential for interoperability between different blockchains.
