EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)
Used by Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Binance-Smart-Chain,...

What is EVM ?
Evm is a could computer operated by all the nodes, it is the accumulation of computer all around the world.
Each computer on the Ethereum network runs a piece of software that is computing the output of smart contract transactions.
So EVM has its own memory, storage and computing numbers units. All of this to understand smart-contract code and process smart-contract transactions.
Solidity is a high-level programming language, developpers can understand it but not the EVM. That is why we compile Solidity code to get executable bytecode the computer can process as any other computer.
Between the Solidity code and the bytecode (higher level than assembly) there is a middle theoretical language called Opcode (shows instructions).
EVM makes it easier to move your application or project from a chain to another if they both use EVM
 
How the EVM processes transactions ?
Transactions are processed sequentially, one by one. If a process does not work it is skipped by the EVM. Everytime the EVM runs a transaction we say that the state of the EVM is updated.As the EVM is a collection of data, each transaction processed by theEWM changes its data and so the state is.
The EVM records every transaction and what the EVM consisted of before and after every single transaction. This list of transactions is what we call the blockchain.
The cost of a transaction is determined by the work the EVM needs to perform. It is possible to know how much a smart-contract is going to cost by looking into the OpCode and the cost of each operation.
