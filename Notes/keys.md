# Cryptographic Keys in Blockchain: Private Keys, Public Keys & Seed Phrases 🔐

## Introduction 🌟
Cryptographic keys are fundamental to blockchain technology, providing the foundation for security, ownership, and transactions. Understanding how these elements work together is essential for anyone working with blockchain development.

## Seed Phrases (Mnemonic Seeds) 🌱

### What is a Seed Phrase? 📝
- A seed phrase (also called mnemonic phrase) is a human-readable representation of entropy that generates a master private key
- Typically consists of 12, 18, or 24 words from a standardized wordlist (BIP-39)
- Functions as the "master key" that can recover all your private keys
- Example: `witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least`

### How Seed Phrases Are Created 🛠️
1. Random entropy is generated (usually 128 or 256 bits)
2. A checksum is added to verify integrity
3. The combined bits are split into 11-bit segments
4. Each 11-bit segment maps to a word in the BIP-39 wordlist (2048 words)

```python
# Simplified seed phrase generation example
import hashlib
import binascii
from bip39wordlist import WORDLIST  # A list of 2048 words

def generate_seed_phrase(entropy_bits=128):
    # Generate random entropy
    entropy = os.urandom(entropy_bits // 8)
    
    # Calculate checksum
    sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256(entropy).digest()
    checksum_bits = entropy_bits // 32
    
    # Add checksum to entropy
    checksum = int.from_bytes(sha256_hash, byteorder='big') >> (256 - checksum_bits)
    entropy_int = int.from_bytes(entropy, byteorder='big')
    entropy_with_checksum = (entropy_int << checksum_bits) | checksum
    
    # Convert to words
    result = []
    for i in range((entropy_bits + checksum_bits) // 11):
        word_index = (entropy_with_checksum >> (((entropy_bits + checksum_bits) // 11) - 1 - i) * 11) & 0x7FF
        result.append(WORDLIST[word_index])
    
    return ' '.join(result)
```

## Private Keys 🔒

### What is a Private Key? 📝
- A private key is a large, randomly generated number (usually 256 bits)
- Mathematically, it's simply an integer between 1 and 2^256 - 1
- Must be kept secret at all times - whoever has the private key controls the assets
- Examples:
  - Hex format: `7d4d0e7f6153a69b6987d879d3f4cbb8e6c2f9a618757a64aa5f6c9c90b7a8c9`
  - WIF format: `KxFC1jmwwCoACiCAWZ3eXa96mBM6tb3TYzGmf6YwgdGWZgawvrtJ`

### Derivation from Seed Phrase 🛠️
1. The seed phrase is converted to a binary seed using PBKDF2
2. HMAC-SHA512 is applied to create a master key and chain code
3. Private keys for different accounts can be derived hierarchically following BIP-32/BIP-44 standards

```python
# Simplified private key derivation from seed phrase
import hmac
import hashlib

def mnemonic_to_seed(mnemonic, passphrase=""):
    # Convert mnemonic to seed using PBKDF2
    salt = "mnemonic" + passphrase
    seed = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac("sha512", mnemonic.encode("utf-8"), 
                               salt.encode("utf-8"), 2048, 64)
    return seed

def derive_master_key(seed):
    # HMAC-SHA512 with key "Bitcoin seed"
    h = hmac.new(b"Bitcoin seed", seed, hashlib.sha512).digest()
    master_private_key = h[:32]
    chain_code = h[32:]
    return master_private_key, chain_code
```

## Public Keys 🔑

### What is a Public Key? 📝
- A public key is derived from the private key using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
- Specifically, most blockchains use the secp256k1 curve for this derivation
- Can be safely shared with others - it's mathematically infeasible to derive the private key from it
- Examples:
  - Uncompressed: `04a1b2c3d4e5...` (130 hex characters, starts with 04)
  - Compressed: `02a1b2c3d4e5...` or `03a1b2c3d4e5...` (66 hex characters, starts with 02 or 03)

### Derivation from Private Key 🛠️
- The public key is calculated as `K = k * G` where:
  - `k` is the private key
  - `G` is the generator point of the secp256k1 curve
  - `*` is elliptic curve point multiplication
  - `K` is the resulting public key (a point on the curve)

```python
# Public key derivation example using secp256k1
from ecdsa import SigningKey, SECP256k1

def private_to_public_key(private_key_hex):
    private_key_bytes = bytes.fromhex(private_key_hex)
    signing_key = SigningKey.from_string(private_key_bytes, curve=SECP256k1)
    verifying_key = signing_key.get_verifying_key()
    
    # Uncompressed public key
    public_key_uncompressed = b'\04' + verifying_key.to_string()
    
    # Compressed public key
    x_coord = verifying_key.to_string()[:32]
    y_coord = verifying_key.to_string()[32:]
    if int(y_coord[-1]) % 2 == 0:
        prefix = b'\02'
    else:
        prefix = b'\03'
    public_key_compressed = prefix + x_coord
    
    return public_key_uncompressed.hex(), public_key_compressed.hex()
```

## Blockchain Addresses 📭

### What is a Blockchain Address? 📝
- An address is derived from the public key through hashing functions
- It's a shorter, more user-friendly representation
- Examples:
  - Bitcoin: `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa`
  - Ethereum: `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e`

### Derivation from Public Key 🛠️
For Bitcoin:
1. SHA-256 hash of the public key
2. RIPEMD-160 hash of the result
3. Add version byte
4. Calculate checksum (double SHA-256)
5. Append checksum
6. Base58 encode

For Ethereum:
1. Keccak-256 hash of the public key
2. Take the last 20 bytes
3. Add '0x' prefix
