A Merkle Tree is a mathematical data structure made up of hashes of various transactions of various data blocks in a specific blockchain network.
It acts like a summary and enables quick and secure content verification.

Hash functions maps any type of arbitrary data of any length to a fixed-size output. They can not be reversed.
Several blockchains are passed to the hash function (it can be sha256).

A Merkle Tree totals all transactions in a block and generates a digital fingerprint of the entire set of operations, allowing the user to verify whether a transaction is included in the block or not.
The transaction ID of each transaction in a same block is a hash of individual transactions.
Then we pair the hashes two by two, hashes are concatenated and hashed again by the same hash function. This way the size of the hash is always the same at every level of the Merkle Tree.The connection between two leaf hashes is called a leaf-node. Leaves are the data at the bottom of the Merkle Tree, they do not have lower connection.We combine and pair hashes until we obtain a hash called Merkle Root from 64 characters transaction ID.

Advantages:
-Validate data integrity
-Save disk space
-It can be broken down into small pieces of data for verification

Without Merkle Tree each node on the Bitcoin network would have to retain a complete copy of every single transaction  
The Merkle root is stored in the header of the block
