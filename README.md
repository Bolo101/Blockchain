## 📌 Topics Covered

- **Solidity** 📝 - The most widely used smart contract language.
- **Vyper** 🐍 - A Pythonic alternative to Solidity.
- **Foundry** 🛠️ - A powerful framework for Ethereum development.
- **Chainlink Feeds** 🔗 - Integrating real-world data into smart contracts.
- **Sepolia Testnet** 🌐 - A go-to test network for Ethereum development.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-dev-notes.git
cd blockchain-dev-notes
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python and Vyper installed.

```bash
pip install web3 vyper
```

For Solidity development, consider using Foundry:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### 3️⃣ Deploy & Test Smart Contracts
Check the contracts/ directory for example smart contracts in Solidity and Vyper.

```bash
forge test  # Run Foundry tests
vyper my_contract.vy  # Compile a Vyper contract
```
